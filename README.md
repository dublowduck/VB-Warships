## Why?
Fun. It was a college project I enjoyed so much that I'm continuing to develop it. It's not a very good port but that's not the point.

## Known bugs
* Game must be run as administrator to access save files, if it isn't the error is not by the program and appears as an unhandled exception.
* Player names are not stored with scores and displayed on the leader board
* On Windows 7 the ships and flags appear as empty boxes, only the water is displayed properly.
* On Windows 11 the "miss flag" is an empty box

## Installation
Download the latest installer in the Releases tab.

### Compatibility
* Windows 11*
* Windows 10 x86
* Windows 7 x86*

*Version 0.1.0 and 0.1.1 will run on Windows 11 but the "miss flag" emoji will be displayed as an empty box. For Windows 7 the ships and hits or misses will be displayed as empty boxes, making the game rather difficult to play. This doesn't seem to be fixable with the current ship drawing system.

## Future features
* Better UI
* Random ship placement for the computer player
* Custom ship placement for the player
* Sound effects/music
* Better enemy "AI"
* Local (same machine) multiplayer
* LAN multiplayer
